Hey guys, this is a short post, just to let you know that I just launched a PWA that solves a very personal problem. 

## The problem
When I go to the gym, three situations coincide:

* I use an app that allows you to use pounds or kilograms but not both.
* My gym uses pounds for machines and kilograms for dumbbells.
* Therefor I need a way to constantly convert units from pounds to kilograms. 

Now, let us explore the alternatives:

* I could do it mentally, but I will not too lazy for that.
* There is an app, but I don't want to see commercials, neither use 25 MB for such a simple app space on my device, nor want to see commercials.
* Just Google it, I could but that means turning on the mobile data. That seems trivial, but I start to get notifications from social apps. The problem is that they induce me train for more time than I should, and make me more prone to injuries due to bad form.
* There is a website for that. Kind of, but they are not fully responsive not PWAs.
* Create a PWA connected to the cloud in order to track your own trainings. I didn't think of that at the time thinking

## The solution 🤓

Use my knowledge and make with these features:

* ️Bidirectional KG to LBS Unit Conversion 🏋️‍
* Dark Theme as default 🌑
* Screen reader tested 🔉
* No User tracking 🔍
* No Ads 📈
* No 💩
* Open source 📚

* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as a boilerplate.
* State management with React Hooks and Context API.
