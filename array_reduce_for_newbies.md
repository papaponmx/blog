### Prerequisites.
In order to get the most out of this post, it is important for you to be familiar with:

- Using functions with parameters.
- Callback functions.
- How return works.
- JavaScript Data types.
- Other Array methods like `Array.filter` or `Array.sort`.

In this article will start by getting familiar with some key terms that will make the `Array.reduce` easier to understand, those key terms are: 

* Reducer.
* Accumulator.


Let's start with a first principles approach and go to the dictionary. According to Dictionary.com, to reduce means:

> 1. To bring down to a smaller extent, size, amount, number, etc.
> 2. To lower in degree, intensity, etc.:

**Synonyms for reduce**
diminish, decrease, shorten, abridge, curtail, contract, retrench.

With this in mind, it now easier to understand what a reducer function is. Simply put, a **reducer function reduces *n* input items to a single return value**.

One of the features that makes `Array.reduce` so powerful, is that we can use an accumulator. let us learn what an accumulator is. Going back to the dictionary, an accumulator is:

> a register used to contain the results of an arithmetical or logical operation.

In the context of our programs, this register can be a variable that is refering a boolean, an array or an object.

Now that we know what a reducer function is, let us explore how `Array.reduce` works.

According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce):

> `Array.reduce` is a method that executes a *reducer function* on each element of the array, resulting in single output value.

Array.reduce takes in two parameters:

1. A reducer function.
2. An initial value for the accumulator.

Let's dive deeper into the reducer function parameter.

### Reducer function

As we have learned before:

> A **reducer function reduces *n* input items to a single return value**.


The reducer function we provide to `Array.reduce` is executed on each element of the array. This function takes in four parameters:

1. accumulator. This is the total value of the accumulator.
2. currentItem. Current item of the array.
3. currentIndex. Current index of the array.
4. sourceArray. This is the array that we want to reduce.

### 

Let's walk trought an example of a **reducer** function that uses an **accumulator** in order to return the highest number in an array:



```javascript

/**
 * Let's break it down step by step:
 
 * 1. Define an array of numbers.
 * 2. We declare the reducer function that will be applied to each element of the array.
 * 3. Within the reducer function, if the currentItem is greater than the accumulator, we will return the currentItem.
 * 4. We invoke numbers.reduce() passing our reducer function as a first parameter and 0 as an initial value for our accumulator. 
 */


const numbers = [3, 4, 10, 1, 4, 3]; // 1. 

const reducerFunction = (accumulator, currentItem, currentIndex, sourceArray) => { // 2. 
    if (accumulator < currentItem) {
        return currentItem; // 3.
    } 
    return accumulator; // ðŸ¤“ Notice that the value that we return in the reducer function, will be the value of the accumulator the next time the reducer function is invoked.
}


const highestNumber = numbers.reduce(reducerFunction, 0); // 4. Notice that 0 is the initial value for our accumulator.


console.log('Highest number is ', highestNumber);
```
